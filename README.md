# Mastodon
Scripts for making Mastodon more manageable.
First up, Defed.py is from user @clarjon1@wireless.cat6.network and I took his example from here https://clarjon1.com/blog/mastodon-defederation-tool and tweaked it to work with a CSV that you give it. 
python Defed.py csvfilename.csv

It will put in Public and Private comments too.
