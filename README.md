# Mastodon
Scripts for making Mastodon more manageable.
First up, Defed.py is from user @clarjon1@wireless.cat6.network and I took his example from here https://clarjon1.com/blog/mastodon-defederation-tool and tweaked it to work with a CSV that you give it. 
python Defed.py csvfilename.csv

It will put in Public comments too.

Added a .json file that can store your key and instance domain. I made it so it can load up lists from Oliphant, available here. https://github.com/sgrigson/oliphant/

Enjoy
